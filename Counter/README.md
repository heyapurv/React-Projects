# React Counter Project

This simple React project, named "Counter Project 1," is a beginner-friendly application that introduces the basic concepts of React. The project utilizes the Vite development environment and focuses on the usage of React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage the state of a counter.

## Project Overview

### Tools Used:
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast, opinionated web development build tool that serves as a frontend tooling framework.

### Project Structure:
The project consists of a single component, `App.js`, responsible for rendering a counter and buttons to increment and decrement its value.

```plaintext
/src
    - App.js
    - App.css
index.html
package.json
vite.config.js
```

## How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd your-repo
```
- Install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
- Start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev 
```
## Project Features

### Counter Display:
- The counter value is prominently displayed on the page.

### Increase Button:
- Clicking the "Increase" button increments the counter value, up to a maximum of 20.

### Decrease Button:
- Clicking the "Decrease" button decrements the counter value, down to a minimum of 0.

## Learning Points

- **React Hooks:**
  - Utilizes the `useState` hook to manage state within functional components.
  - Demonstrates how to conditionally update state based on specific criteria.
